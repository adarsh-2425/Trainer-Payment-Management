MUST DO STEPS!! </br>

1. After git clone, navigate to BackEnd directory and type "npm i" in the terminal</br>
2. navigate to the FrontEnd directory, and type "npm i" in the terminal</br>

"npm i" is used to install all predefined dependencies from package.json. So that we dont have to install each one of them manually.</br>


IMPORTANT</br>

Before your every "git push origin main", do "git pull origin main" first </br>
our primary branch is main, not master!
